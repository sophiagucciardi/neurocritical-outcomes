**[Patient Outcomes in Neurocritically Ill Patients](https://public.tableau.com/views/OutcomesforNeurocriticallyIllICUPatients/NeurocriticalPatientOutcomes?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:sid=&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)**

## Introduction
This dataset was sourced from Dr. Jeong Am Ryu, a critical care medicine doctor at Samsung Medical Center in South Korea. 
With this dataset, I wanted to examine the outcomes in neurocritcally ill patients admitted to the ICU. I specifically wanted to examine the length of time patients were admitted for, what they were admitted for, prognostic tools that could be and were used, mortality rates, and patient information such as age and sex. 

## Data/operation abstraction design:
I did not have to do much to prepare my data. It was already clean, and the most I had to do was create a few calculated fields for my own specific needs. For example, I created a "Days Admitted" field by using the admission and discharge dates.

## Future work:
In the future, I would like to compare this data to a similar dataset for American patients if one exists. Because this dataset came from a South Korean population, a country with single payer healthcare, I would like to investigate if outcomes are significantly different for American patients. I would specifically be interested in examining whether length of stay is different for American patients, as well as mortality.
